    "question": "How would you describe your prophetic calling and when did you first become aware of it?",
    "answer": "I started prophesying at the age of 12—though back then, I didn’t know what prophecy was. I wasn’t trying to be prophetic. I just spoke what I felt the Spirit was saying to me. It was a knowing, a sensing, and I would speak it out, saying, “Thus saith the Lord,” not because someone told me to, but because it was how the Spirit moved through me. The adults in my church recognized there was something on my life. They never called me a prophet—they just said, “The call of God is on Deborah.”",

    "answer": "It’s humbling—and at the same time, it’s exciting. I feel like I’m constantly living in a space called What’s next? What is God saying today? What is God saying to me? To the church? To my family? And even to the world? Walking as a prophetic woman is a reminder—a sign—that God still speaks. I walk with a deep awareness that God has placed a mantle on me—not because of anything I did, but because of His grace.",

It’s not coming from my head; it’s something I discern in my spirit. I’ve always interpreted what God is saying through how I feel it in my being. Because I’ve walked with the Lord for so long, I’ve learned to recognize when it’s Him.",
